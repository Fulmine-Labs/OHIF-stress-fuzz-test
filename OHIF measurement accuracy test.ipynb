    "# Overview\n",
    "This Python test script, run from Anaconda/Jupyter tests the accuracy of length measurements created in the OHIF wie..er \n",
    "It requires, Windows, Chrome, Brave, Anconda/Jupyter and access to the OHIF viewer.\n",
    "For more description of prerequsites and context, see the README.txt file in the github repository.\n",

    "# Analysis/Model Description\n",
    "This test is an independent test oracle for OHIF measurements, which calculates the expected a randomly drawn length asum\n",
    "easuremt in millimeters (mm) based on the pixel spacing of a DICOM image, the scaling factors derived from the image's display size versus its original size, and the deltas (pixel movements) from a simulted mouse movement, using the followng formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Measurement Length (mm) = sqrt((Δx * Scaling Factor X * Pixel Spacing X)^2 + (Δy * Scaling Factor Y * Pixel Spacing Y)^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- Δx and Δy are the pixel movements in the X and Y dimensions, respectively.\n",
    "- Scaling Factor X and Scaling Factor Y are the scaling factors in the X and Y dimensions, respectively, calculated based on the ratio of the DICOM image size to the displayed image size.\n",
    "- Pixel Spacing X and Pixel Spacing Y are the physical distances in millimeters that each pixel represents in the X and Y dimensions respectively, as obtained from the DICOM header of the image\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected result is then compared with the actual length as rendered in the browser.\n",
    "The test passes if all rulers drawn are the same lengths as the expected lengths, within a specified tolerance.\n",
